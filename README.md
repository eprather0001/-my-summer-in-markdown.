# -my-summer-in-markdown.

## Introduction

My name is Ellie Prather. I am in 10th grade at Chatsworth Charter High School. I am also on the volleyball team. 

## Summer Activities

This summer I did many fun things. I went bowling with with a lot of my friends. I went on vacation to Palm Springs for a week where I saw fireworks, went swimming, and went shopping. I also went to two concerts this summer. In Palm Springs I went to a New Kids On The Block concert with my mom, grandma, and younger sister. The second concert I went to was a Niall Horan concert. I went with my mom and one of my friends. 

## Favorite Book and Movie

This summer I watched a lot of movies but only read one book. The book I am reading is called Mistborn: Hero of Ages, by Brandon Sanderson. This is the third book in the Mistborn series and it is my favorite. I didn't get to watch the new movies that came out this summer like Inside Out 2 or Despicable Me 4 but I did rewatch old movies. I rewatched all 3 High School Musical movies and High School Music 2 is my favorite. 

## Most Memorable Moment

My most memborable moment from this summer was going to the Niall Horan concert. This is my most memorable moment because Niall Horan is my favorite music artist. I've always been a One Direction fan with Niall being my favorite member. Getting the oppurtuinity to go to his concert with a friend was amazing. 

## Sports

Over the summer I had practice and tournmanets for the volleyball team here at school. Our summer season started in early July and I had practice everyday expect for Fridays. We also had multiple tournamnets where we played against other schools.
